# Machine_Learning_Project-Heart_Disease_Prediction

Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

📌 Project Overview: 
The Heart Disease Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the Decision Tree Algorithm, to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical parameters. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health-related features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors.

🚀 Features: 
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Decision Tree-based classification model
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of decision tree structure
Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on input health metrics

🛠️ Technologies Used: 
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier

📊 Model Training & Evaluation: 
Data is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the training data.
The model’s performance is evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
